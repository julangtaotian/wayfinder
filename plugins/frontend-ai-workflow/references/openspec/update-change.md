description: Update an OpenSpec change by revising its existing planning artifacts and keeping them coherent with one another. Use when the user wants to revise a change's plan, fold new decisions into it, or reconcile its artifacts after an edit. Never edits code. Uses the plugin-bundled OpenSpec CLI.

## Bundled Runtime and Root Boundary

Resolve `<plugin-root>` as the directory two levels above this reference folder. Execute every `openspec ...` command shown below as `node "<plugin-root>/scripts/openspec-cli.mjs" ...`. Never invoke, install, or update a global OpenSpec CLI.

For a plugin-managed local project, inspect `root` in every JSON response. If `root.source` is `global_default` without an explicit Store choice from the user, stop before writing and ask for an explicit Store or local project root.

Revise a change's existing planning artifacts and keep them coherent. Never edit code.

## Plugin Integration Contract

Before following this planning-only reference, classify the revision:

- If scope, visible behavior, interface, permission, security, data, or compatibility semantics change, first revise the linked requirement ledger, acceptances, evidence mapping, interaction matrix, change-scope row, and R-* history. Reset invalidated V-* records and reopen affected completed tasks.
- If no D-* semantics change, record the requirement basis and continue with planning artifacts only.

Run the plan-stage requirement validator after any fact-source revision. This reference never authorizes a planning artifact, context, or operation guidance to invent or override a business decision.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `view`). Once selected, treat `--store <id>` as sticky for the rest of the workflow and append it to every applicable unscoped example below. Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes sorted by most recently modified, and ask the user to select one

   When prompting, present the top 3-4 most recently modified changes as options, showing:
   - Change name
   - Schema (from `schema` field if present, otherwise "spec-driven")
   - Status (e.g., "0/5 tasks", "complete", "no tasks")
   - How recently it was modified (from `lastModified` field)

   Mark the most recently modified change as "(Recommended)" since it's likely what the user wants to update.

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `$openspec-update-change <other>`).

2. **Get the change's artifacts**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand current state. The response includes:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow schema being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - `artifacts`: Array of artifacts with their status ("done", "skipped", "ready", "blocked")
   - `isPlanningComplete`: Boolean indicating if all planning artifacts are complete; older responses expose the same value as `isComplete`
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context. Use these instead of assuming repo-local paths.

   The artifact ids and paths come from the active schema - do NOT assume them, and do NOT branch on hardcoded artifact names. Custom schemas must work unchanged.

   The files to edit are `artifactPaths.<id>.existingOutputPaths` - the concrete files that exist on disk, already glob-expanded for glob artifacts (e.g. `specs/**/*.md`). Do NOT write to `resolvedOutputPath`: for a glob artifact it is still the glob pattern, not a real file.

3. **Understand the request**
   - If the user asked for a specific revision ("the design now uses X"), that is the starting edit.
   - If they only said "update" / "make this coherent", treat it as a coherence review: read the existing artifacts and check them against each other for contradictions, gaps, and duplication.

4. **Read and reconcile**
   - Read the artifact(s) the request touches and the change's other existing artifacts.
   - Apply the requested edit. Then check every other existing artifact against it - in ANY direction: an edit to a later artifact may require revising an earlier one, not only the other way around. Build order is a useful reading order, not a constraint on which artifacts may be revised.
   - Note everything that is now inconsistent, missing, or contradictory.
   - Revise only files that already exist (`existingOutputPaths`). Do NOT create artifacts that don't exist yet, and do NOT invent new files under a glob artifact - note them and point the user to `$openspec-continue-change` to create them.
   - If the change is already coherent, say so and make no edits.

5. **Confirm and apply, one artifact at a time**
   - Show each proposed revision and why. Write only after the user confirms.
   - If the user rejects a revision, do not write it - leave that artifact unchanged.
   - When a substantial rewrite is needed, get that artifact's rules and template first:
     ```bash
     openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
     ```

6. **Point to the next step (guidance only - NEVER act on it)**
   - Artifacts still missing -> suggest `$openspec-continue-change` to create them.
   - Change already implemented (tasks checked off / already applied) -> the code may no longer match the revised plan; suggest `$openspec-apply-change` to carry the delta into code.
   - Everything done and implemented -> suggest `$openspec-archive-change`.

**Output**

After each invocation, show:
- Which artifacts were revised (and which proposed revisions were rejected)
- Anything deferred to `$openspec-continue-change` (not-yet-created artifacts or files)
- Where the change stands and the recommended next command

**Guardrails**
- Planning artifacts only - NEVER edit implementation code. If the revised plan implies code changes, stop and point to `$openspec-apply-change`.
- Use the artifact ids and paths reported by `openspec status`; never branch on hardcoded artifact names.
- Edit only the concrete files in `existingOutputPaths`; never write to a glob `resolvedOutputPath`.
- Do not advance the build frontier: no new artifacts, no new files under glob artifacts - that is `$openspec-continue-change`'s job.
- Confirm every edit with the user before writing.
- If the request changes the change's *intent* rather than refining it, recommend starting fresh with `$openspec-new-change` (the "Update vs. Start Fresh" heuristic).
- `$openspec-continue-change` and `$openspec-new-change` may not be installed (core profile). Check availability before suggesting either. For an unavailable continue workflow, use `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` and `openspec instructions "<artifact-id>" --change "<name>" --json`; for an intent-changing revision with no new-change workflow, require a distinct unused name before suggesting `openspec new change "<new-change-name>"`.
